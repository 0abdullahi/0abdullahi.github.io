Hola 👋🏼 My name is Abdullahi.

My journey into cybersecurity wasn’t exactly planned. I was pursuing a completely different degree when a long university strike by professors brought everything to a halt. While waiting, I stumbled across cybersecurity program almost by accident and before I knew it, I was deep into studying how computers work, different types of networks, vulnerabilities, and security concepts. 

Today, I work as Offensive Security Engineer focusing on: Application Security, Cloud Environment Configurations, Source Code reviews, and Generative AI tests. Simply put, breaking into systems before bad guys do. 

# About this site

This blog is my little corner of the internet, a place where I document what I’ve discovered, reflect on hard earned lessons (through rabbitholes), and experiment with new tools and techniques. It's part learning journal, part public notebook. It's a way for me to sharpen my thinking, improve my writing, and quiet that persistent voice of imposter syndrome we all wrestle with sometimes.
Whether you just stubmled on this site or starting out in this field or have been in the field for years, I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity.

> I am by no means an expert in all things cybersecurity. If you spot something I got wrong, or if you see a different perspective, I’d love to hear from you.
