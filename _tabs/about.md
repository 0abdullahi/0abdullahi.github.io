Hola 👋🏼 

I am Abdullahi, born to be a geeljire 🐪 (Nomad), forced to be breaking into software applications.\
A pentester by day, gym rat by afternoon and hopping between unfinished side projects by night.\
A wannabe founder, entrepreneur, and athlete (yah… not happening)

My journey into cybersecurity wasn’t exactly part of the master plan. I was chasing a totally different degree when a university strike hit. While waiting, I stumbled into a cybersecurity program.\
Then spent some years neck deep learning how computers work, the internet, packet sniffing, participating in CTF challenges, vulnerability hunting and neverending troubleshooting.

These days, I work as Offensive Security Engineer focusing on: Application Security, Cloud Environment Configurations reviews, Source Code reviews, and Generative AI tests. As they say: breaking into systems before bad guys do.

# About this site

This blog is my little corner of the internet, a place where I document what I’ve discovered, reflect on hard earned lessons (through rabbitholes), and experiment with new tools and techniques. It's part learning journal, part public notebook. It's a way for me to sharpen my thinking, improve my writing, and quiet that persistent voice of imposter syndrome we all wrestle with sometimes. 

Whether you just stumbled on this site or starting out in this field or have been in the field for years, I hope you find something here that sparks your curiosity.

> I am by no means an expert in all things cybersecurity. If you spot something I got wrong, or if you see a different perspective, I’d love to hear from you.
